**Usage (1 sentence)**
After you‚Äôve verified and locked-in the manifest, run `python dedup_clean.py` to physically delete every file whose `delete_flag` is **true** (plus its JSON sidecar), mark the outcome in `metadata_manifest.csv`, and append a detailed audit line to `dedup_deletion_log.txt`.

### Idea summary (what it does & why it matters)

`dedup_clean.py` is the *irreversible* final act of the deduplication pipeline. It walks the manifest, normalizes each stored path to the current OS (e.g., `C:\‚Ä¶` ‚Üí `/mnt/c/‚Ä¶` for WSL), and‚Äîonly for rows where `delete_flag=true`‚Äîtries to remove both the media file and its metadata JSON. Each success or failure is appended to a human-readable log, and the script updates the CSV with a `deletion_status` so future passes can safely skip already-handled rows. By combining atomic manifest edits, OS-agnostic path translation, and granular logging, the script offers a transparent, auditable, and repeatable way to reclaim disk space without risking accidental double-deletes or silent data loss.
