**Usage (1 sentence)**
Run `python find_file.py <substring_or_filename> [--exact]` to recursively search both the external `D:\` drive and the main *Processing* tree‚Äîplus the contents of every ZIP it encounters‚Äîfor any file whose name matches (or exactly equals) the given pattern.

### Tools / Technologies employed

* **Python 3.x standard library** ‚Äì `os.walk` for directory traversal, `pathlib` for OS-agnostic paths, `zipfile` for reading archive contents, and `sys` for minimal CLI parsing.
* **Windows-aware search roots** ‚Äì pre-defined list of absolute paths so the script can sweep a whole drive and your curated photo archive in one pass.
* **Corrupted-ZIP handling** ‚Äì graceful skip with a warning to avoid crashes when an archive is damaged.

### Idea summary (what it does & why it matters)

`find_file.py` is a Swiss-army locator that answers ‚ÄúWhere did that file go?‚Äù across millions of photos and archives. By checking both live directories **and** drilling into every `.zip`, it can track down originals, renamed copies, or stray metadata without unpacking everything first. The optional `--exact` flag switches between substring discovery and strict filename equality, while clear emoji-tagged logs show progress and alert you to unreadable archives. This quick command-line utility saves minutes (or hours) of manual digging whenever a file referenced in the manifest or log can‚Äôt be found, tightening the feedback loop during debugging and data recovery.
